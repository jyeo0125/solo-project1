# Slide Me! 

## Overview
-------------------
- This game(Slide Me!) based on a slide image puzzle, and two players take each turn and move the shuffled image pieces to make complete image. 
- The overview of the Slide me! This game needs to use many materials that we learned from the past two weeks, and this project also helps me cover many class materials that I need to practice.

- When the game starts, the original image of the picture shows two seconds.
- Each player move(slide) the piece of the puzzle in each tern.
